    <p> We met in 2009 in a tiny cobblestone alleyway in the coastal Scottish town of St Andrews, both hiding from the rain.  As it turns out, we were about to start our first day of work at Flip! After a couple months of getting to know each other, Nick finally made his move. Little did we know, a part-time job and a few hundred paninis and wraps later, we'd be getting married.</p>

<p>Fast forward to graduating with our Masters degrees in late 2010, and we were faced with the new reality of being in love with someone from another country.  Nick moved back to the States, while Shane headed back to Canada.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2011, we spent a lot of time in airports, with lots of tearful goodbyes.  We decided that the best way to get ourselves in the same country again would be taking a giant leap of faith.  It meant moving to China!</p>

<p>After too many noodles, many days lost in translation (for Shane) and too many crazy adventures to count, we started our little family with our newest four-legged rescues, Chance and Rice.</p>

<p>Moving back to North America meant back to long distance - this time splitting up our babies as well.  Nick got Chance, Shane got Rice.</p>

<p>In March of 2014, Nick finally made his next big move and asked the question Shane had been very (im)patiently waiting for.  The answer was undoubtedly yes.</p>

<p>Over the course of four years, we've been around the world and back, falling more in love along the way - but really, the best is yet to be...</p>
